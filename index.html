                    At CMS, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to reshape the way we use data to make
                    decisions. In fact, because CMS is such a data-rich agency, there is no better place to
                    implement AI technology. To do so responsibly, we must educate our workforce, share
                    knowledge with our partners, follow ethical standards, and experiment with new methodologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we have created this website. It offers a starting point for stakeholders
                    interested in any aspect of AI at CMS.

                <h1>Leveraging the power of AI to serve America's healthcare needs</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        With nearly 150 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Child Health
                        Insurance Program, CMS possessesone of the most robust data portfolios in the federal
                        government. We house patient and provider claims, beneficiary enrollments, and medical
                        records, along with internal data such as budget documents and contract records.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a key role in leveraging all of this data to
                        fulfill its mission of advancinghealth equity, expanding coverage, and improving health
                        outcomes for the American public. As defined by the Department of Health and Human Services,
                        “AI enables computer systems to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AI can analyze data, automate labor-intensive processes, find operational efficiencies,
                        provide business insights, interact with customers, make predictions, identify disparities,
                        and reveal new ways of solving problems. In short, AI is an emerging technology that will
                        positively impact both CMS and the public we serve. The impacts include cost savings and
                        better health outcomes.

                                    prototype AI applications for testing and potential development. For two
                                    years, OIT accepted proposals for projects that applied AI and ML techniques related
                                    to CMS's mission and to the applicant's team functional area. From these
                                    submissions,OIT executive leadership supported 10 total projects. Support included
                                    funding and matching with pre-qualified vendors. Awardees tested their hypotheses
                                    over the course of three to six months.

                                    transforming the way business gets done. According to <a

                                    In the era of “Big Data”, it’s not hard to find information. Turning that
                                    information into knowledge, however, is
                                    another story. That’s what data science is all about. It’s an interdisciplinary
                                    field that uses scientific methods,
                                    processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights from noisy structured and
                                    unstructured data, and to apply those
                                    insights across a broad range of applications.

                                    Data science is reshaping healthcare in multiple applications, for example by
                                    improving diagnostic accuracy and
                                    optimizing clinical performance. CMS oversees multiple federal healthcare programs
                                    and generates an extensive amount of
                                    data daily that, when understood, can further streamline effective healthcare
                                    delivery to the American public. In sum,
                                    data science practices can help us reduce work burdens, make better decisions, and
                                    optimize solutions for our
                                    stakeholders. The practice of data science entails gathering data, examining it,
                                    sorting it, modeling it, interpreting
                                    it, and visualizing it. The Data Science Track of WR is your first step to
