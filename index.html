                    At CMS, AI has the power to reshape the way we use data to make decisions. In fact, there is no
                    better place to implement AI technology. AI is driven by data, and CMS is an extremely data-rich
                    agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To implement AI, and to do so responsibly, we must educate our workforce, share knowledge with
                    our partners, follow ethical standards, and experiment with new methodologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we have created this website. It offers a starting point for anyone interested in
                    any aspect of AI at CMS.

                <h1>Leveraging the power of AI to serve America's healthcare needs</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        There are nearly 150 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Child Health
                        Insurance Program. We house patient and provider claims, enrollments, and medical records, along
                        with internal data such as budget documents and contractor data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AI can find patterns in this data that may not be accessible via manual methods of analysis,
                        either
                        because it would take too long or because a human can only process so much information at once.
                        Aside from sorting the data, AI can help us to learn from it. Further, AI can automate
                        labor-intensive manual processes, find operational efficiencies, provide insights from
                        information,
                        make predictions, identify disparities, and reveal new ways of solving problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, AI is an emerging technology that should have a wide impact throughout CMS and
                        ultimately,
                        for the American public. These impacts include resource savings and better health outcomes.

                                    apply AI and ML techniques related to
                                    CMS's mission and to the applicant's team functional area. From these submissions,

                                    In the era of “Big Data”, it’s not hard to find information. Turning that
                                    information
                                    into knowledge, however, is another story. That’s what data science is all about.
                                    It’s
                                    an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and
                                    systems to extract insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and to
                                    apply
                                    those insights across a broad range of applications.</p>

                                    Data science is reshaping healthcare in multiple applications, for example by
                                    improving
                                    diagnostic accuracy and optimizing clinical performance. CMS oversees multiple
                                    federal
                                    healthcare programs and generates an extensive amount of data daily that, when
                                    understood, can further streamline effective healthcare delivery to the American
                                    public.
                                    In sum, data science practices can help us reduce work burdens, make better
                                    decisions,
                                    and optimize solutions for our stakeholders. The practice of data science entails
                                    gathering data, examining it, sorting it, modeling it, interpreting it, and
                                    visualizing
                                    it. The Data Science Track of WR is your first step to empowering yourself with
                                    knowledge of these techniques.
